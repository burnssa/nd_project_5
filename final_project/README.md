##Summary 
From 2007 to 2014 the number of reported crimes fell substantially in Oakland, California - a city commonly associated with violence and crime. This choropleth highlights how Oakland's crime rate evolved over this period, in each of the city's neighborhoods, for some of the most common types of crime. The chart's neighborhoods are as defined in the GeoJson files kindly shared by Max Ogden [here](https://github.com/maxogden/oakland-boundaries-geojson). Crime incidents are taken from the [OpenOakland](www.openoakland.org) [database here](http://data.openoakland.org/dataset/crime-reports/resource/49bee847-a9b7-4e71-84d8-3f4cabb26cf0).

##Design

The chart incorporates a 'martini-glass' structure, with an initial author-driven narrative highlighted by changes in color saturation for each neighborhood corresponding to crime report frequency. Once the chart animation reaches the most recent year in the data set, the user is free to construct his or her own narratives, and explore changes between various years for any given crime category, by selecting from columns of buttons.

##Feedback
- Need to add explanations for categories
- Recenter titles
- Call out name of each neighborhood
